<p><div class="entry-content">
<p>As usual, the 2013&nbsp;<a title="Apple Developer iOS7" href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/" target="_blank">Apple WWDC</a> event had quite a few announcements, notably the changes in iOS7 for iOS app developers. &nbsp;There are significant changes in overall vision of iOS, from design to how developers build their apps for iOS7.</p>
<p>Apple released a full developer transition guide for Apple Developers (available if you have an account). After reading the document, I have to say that there are some impactful changes, mostly for the better.</p>
<blockquote><p>iOS 7 introduces many UI changes, such as borderless buttons, translucent bars, and full-screen layout for view controllers. Using Xcode 5, you can build a project for iOS 7 and run it in iOS 7 Simulator to get a first glimpse of the way the app looks with iOS 7 UI.</p></blockquote>
<h2><img class=" wp-image-549 aligncenter" title="iOS7 Changes for Developers" alt="iOS7-CHANGES-FOR-DEVELOPERS" src="http://natemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/iOS7-CHANGES-FOR-DEVELOPERS.png" width="500" height="398" scale="0"></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple thinks that when you start using iOS7, a few things will become clear about the main purpose and vision of the new iOS version:</p>
<blockquote><p>Deference. The UI helps users understand and interact with the content, but never competes with it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Clarity. Text is legible at every size, icons are precise and lucid, adornments are subtle and appropriate,&nbsp;and a sharpened focus on functionality motivates the design.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Depth. Visual layers and realistic motion heighten users’ delight and understanding.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>As the smartphone and app era matures, we’re seeing a push towards simplicity with a goal of reducing noise. I strongly believe the future of technology lies in “natural” tech — technology and products designed to improve our lives that fit in as a natural part of our environment. This can be applied to small wearable technology, like the <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/flex">Fitbit</a>, or an extremely simple UI design that gets out of the way, like the <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/" target="_blank">Moves</a> app. You can go back and forth over design aesthetics in the new iOS version but I will never argue with a push towards simplicity and ease of use.</p>
<p>iOS7 also introduces dynamic type, which resizes text throughout iOS based on user preferences. This should make text appear more natural and be easier to read for each individual user.</p>
<div id="attachment_550" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><img class=" wp-image-550" title="iOS7 Dynamic Type Example" alt="iOS7-DYNAMIC-TYPE" src="http://natemcguire.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/iOS7-DYNAMIC-TYPE.png" width="500" height="377" scale="0"><p class="wp-caption-text">iOS7 Dynamic Type Example</p></div>
<blockquote><p>Automatic adjustments to weight, letter spacing, and line height for every font size.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The ability to specify different text styles for semantically distinct blocks of text, such as Body, Footnote, or Headline1.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Text that responds appropriately to changes in both the Dynamic Type and accessibility settings for user-specified text sizes.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Issues for developers</h2>
<p>The changes in iOS7 will impact existing applications the most, especially those apps that rely heavily on the system-based templates for the application UI. This would include any app that relies on system styled buttons, navigation bars, and UI buttons. If your application uses these elements, when users upgrade to iOS7, they will see the new iOS7 buttons with the framework you intended for use in iOS6. This is obviously not great for existing apps – you will have to test your app on iOS7 and likely maintain a separate version for iOS6 in your development tree. If you need to maintain multiple versions of an app, Apple’s Xcode 5&nbsp;<a title="Apple iOS6 and iOS7 parallel support by Xcode5 " href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/SupportingEarlieriOS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013174-CH14-SW1" target="_blank">allows developers</a>&nbsp;to manage multiple versions of an app in addition to allowing you to compare the differences using Apple’s Auto Layout. A primary example of an app that will need some updating is&nbsp;Facebook’s mobile application. Their app relies heavily on default system buttons for some of its actions, and on iOS7 the system styled elements look completely out of place in the older framework.</p>
<h3>iOS7 Button Containers</h3>
<p>If you have built an iOS app before from scratch, you’ll know that programming in Cocoa to build iOS apps involves learning about a few iOS idiosyncrasies, to say the least. Well, another big change that will affect nearly every app – Apple has removed the concept of a button container, so your application buttons are now<em> only text</em>. Basically iOS7 would consider the container (and custom code and design) around your ‘Back’ button in the navigation irrelevant. This is a big change because most apps are using either custom code or background images to create buttons in the navigation and they will now look completely out of place on the new version of iOS.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>We’re in the middle of the icon design process for <a title="Recipeas App - We tell you what to cook with what you have." href="http://recipeasapp.com" target="_blank">Recipeas</a>&nbsp;and there are a few things worth noting from a design and aesthetic perspective. Apple decided to change the&nbsp;radii of the icon corners on iOS7, they’re now 12pt as opposed to iOS6′s 10pt corners. Any icons based on one iOS will end up looking bad on the other.&nbsp;Love it or hate it, iOS7 is on its way to us, and more importantly our users. To make sure your app is iOS7 ready, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/TransitionGuide.pdf" target="_blank">Apple recommends</a> every app review this “to do” list before launching your app for iOS7.</p>
<h2>Things Every App Should Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that app content is discernible through translucent UI elements—such as bars and keyboards—and the transparent status bar. In iOS 7, view controllers use full-screen layout (to learn more, see “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/AppearanceCustomization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013174-CH15-SW2" target="_blank">Using View Controllers</a>”).</li>
<li>Redesign custom bar button icons. In iOS 7, bar button icons are lighter in weight and have a different style.</li>
<li>Prepare for borderless buttons by moving away from supplying button background images and by reassessing your layout.</li>
<li>Examine your app for hard-coded UI values—such as sizes and positions—and replace them with those you derive dynamically from system-provided values. Use Auto Layout to help your app respond when layout changes are required. (If you’re new to Auto Layout, learn about it by reading <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853" target="_blank">Cocoa Auto Layout Guide</a>.)</li>
<li>Examine your app for places where the metrics and style changes of UIKit controls and views affect the layout and appearance. For example, switches are wider, grouped tables are no longer inset, and progress views are thinner. For more information on specific UI elements, see “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/Bars.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013174-CH8-SW1" target="_blank">Bars and Bar Buttons</a>”, “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/Controls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013174-CH9-SW1" target="_blank">Controls</a>”, “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/ContentViews.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013174-CH10-SW1" target="_blank">Content Views</a>”, and “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/TempViews.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013174-CH11-SW1" target="_blank">Temporary Views</a>”.</li>
<li>Scope the Project: Adopt Dynamic Type. In iOS 7, users can adjust the text size they see in apps. When you adopt Dynamic Type, you get text that responds appropriately to user-specified size changes. For more information, see “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/AppearanceCustomization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013174-CH15-SW4" target="_blank">Using Fonts</a>”.</li>
<li>Make sure your app doesn’t respond inappropriately to the new Control Center gesture or to a navigation contoller’s swipe to go back gesture, especially if you perform custom touch handling.</li>
<li>Revisit the use of drop shadows, gradients, and bezels. Because the iOS 7 aesthetic is smooth and layered—with much less emphasis on using visual effects to make UI elements look physical—you may want to rethink these effects.</li>
<li>If necessary, update your app to best practices for iOS 6—such as Auto Layout and storyboards—and ensure that the app uses no deprecated API.</li>
